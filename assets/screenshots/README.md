# Screenshots Directory

This directory contains gameplay screenshots for documentation.

## Required Screenshot

**`gameplay.png`** - Main gameplay screenshot showing:
- Player character on platforms
- Barrels rolling down
- Ladder climbing
- Score and lives display
- Timer
- Overall game layout

### How to Add Screenshot

1. Open the game in browser (`index.html`)
2. Play until you have a good gameplay moment with:
   - Player visible on a platform
   - Some barrels on screen
   - UI elements visible (score, lives, timer)
3. Take screenshot (OS-specific):
   - **Windows**: Windows + Shift + S
   - **Mac**: Command + Shift + 4
   - **Linux**: Screenshot tool or Print Screen
4. Crop to game canvas area (1280×720)
5. Save as `gameplay.png` in this directory
6. Update README.md to use the real screenshot

### Temporary Note

The README currently references `assets/screenshots/gameplay.png` but the actual screenshot needs to be added by running the game and capturing it. The link will work once the screenshot is added.

### Recommended Resolution

- **Full canvas**: 1280×720 pixels
- **Format**: PNG (lossless)
- **File size**: Aim for under 500KB
- **Quality**: High quality showing clear game elements
